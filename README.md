# American-Sign-Language-Recognition

## Capstone Project for TRAIN, AI/ML course offered by the Coding School
In this project I have built a CNN model with 99% accuracy using keras and MNIST ASL dataset.

The model developed can classify any letter in the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet into the equivalent letter in the English Alphabet, which is a multiclass classification problem.

Using this model, we can easily convert the ASL into the respective English sentences.

## Future goals
In the near future, I plan to develop a Streamlit app, providing an accessible and user-friendly platform for real-time ASL translation using the model I built. Looking ahead, I also aim to develop a live translation system that converts videos into ASL.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, through this capstone project, I’ve not only built a highly accurate ASL recognition model but also navigated through the beginner import challenges of Keras and TensorFlow to the intricacies of CNN layer design. These challenges were stepping stones that led to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the AI/ML field. I am deeply thankful for the knowledge and skills gained through TRAIN’s AI/ML program, which has been pivotal in achieving this milestone.
